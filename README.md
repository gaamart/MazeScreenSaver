The main goal is to reproduce the Windows 95 3D Maze Screensaver.
Currently the project consists of a 2D maze prototype with all the basic features required to reproduce the 3D Maze screensaver like:
- Dynamic Maze generation algorithm
- Maze navigation algorithm
- Runner incrementaly moves and rotates during navigation
- Maze's exit condition, represented by the tile blue
- Restart loop at exit position

## Next Steps
- Replace the solid color by textures 
- Create the 3D rendering of the maze
- Add a camera 
- Move the camera around maze navigation

## Windows Building
All external files required to build the project are found in the /libs and /include folders. 
This project was created using Visual Studio so you can find the solution and the project files in the repository.
